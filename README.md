TODO:
* Examples of state management with:
    - InheritedWidget
    - Redux
    - RxDart

* Multiple environments
* Mock server
    - https://pub.dev/packages/mock_web_server
    - https://pub.dev/packages/jaguar
    
* Firebase (analytics, push messages, crash reports)
* Unit tests
* End-to-End tests
* Use localized text

Guidelines:
* Use integers instead floats in paddins, margins, etc when possible
* Use single quote instead of double quote
* Use [] instead of <Widget>[]
* Use => notation for a single line function
* Use 'var' when declaring variables in methods
* Use imports with 'package:...' instead of relative paths
